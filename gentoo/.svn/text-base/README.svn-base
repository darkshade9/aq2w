Gentoo related installation files.

= Overlay Installation =

''An overlay is how you override or add packages to the Gentoo package manager, Portage.  Quake2World has a custom overlay designed to allow Portage to manage your quake2world installation.  The following instructions describe two ways of installing the overlay.'' 

== Layman Overlay ==
''Layman is a software package that allows for easy overlay installations and upgrades.  It is the recommended way to install the quake2world overlay.''

 * Install `layman` if it isn't installed already.
{{{
#!sh
$ emerge layman -av
}}}
 * Add the quake2world overlay source to `/etc/layman/layman.cfg`.
{{{
# layman.cfg
...
# add the overlay source to the list of overlays
overlays = http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/layman-global.txt
           http://jdolan.dyndns.org/svn/quake2world/trunk/gentoo/quake2world-layman-list.xml
...
# allow 3rd party overlays to be listed
nocheck  : yes
}}}
 * Add the quake2world overlay.
{{{
#!sh
$ layman -a quake2world
}}}
''Any time you want to update the overlay, simply run `layman -S`.''

== Traditional Overlay ==

 * Pick a place for your overlay.  Usually `/usr/portage/local`.
 * Check out the overlay to this directory.
{{{
#!sh
$ cd /usr/portage/local
$ svn co svn://jdolan.dyndns.org/quake2world/trunk/gentoo/quake2world-overlay
}}}
 * Add the overlay to your `make.conf`.
{{{
#!sh
$ echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${PORTDIR_OVERLAY} /usr/portage/local/quake2world-overlay"' >> /etc/make.conf
}}}
 * Anytime you want to update the overlay, update the svn source.
{{{
#!sh
$ svn up /usr/portage/local/quake2world-overlay
}}}

= Installing Quake2world =

== Emerging Quake2world ==

''After the overlay is installed, you can install or upgrade `quake2world` with portage.  There is no official release, so the ebuild is marked as version 9999 (indicating trunk) and masked as testing(~x86).''

 * Unmask `quake2world`.
{{{
#!sh
$ echo games-fps/quake2world >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
}}}
 * Emerge quake2world.
{{{
#!sh
$ emerge quake2world -av
}}}

== Installation Notes ==

There is a `nodata` use flag if you would like to skip downloading the game data during install.
{{{
#!sh
$ echo games-fps/quake2world nodata >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
}}}

There is a script to update game data, `quake2world-update-data`.  This should probably only be run when the software is updated.  So unless you know what you are doing, use `emerge quake2world -av` to get updates and don't enable the nodata USE flag.
