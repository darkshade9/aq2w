SUMMARY

Quake2World is a Free, standalone first person shooter video game. Our goal
is to bring the fun and excitement of straightforward old-school death-match
gaming to a more contemporary platform, and perhaps to a new generation of 
gamers.

INSTALL

Compilation of Quake2World is only recommended for users running GNU/Linux or
FreeBSD.  Windows users should consider using our pre-compiled snapshots, see
http://quake2world.net/books/documentation/installation-maintenance

For GNU/Linux, ensure you have the following dependencies at these minimum 
versions:

  gcc          4.0
  automake     1.9.6
  autoconf     2.59
  libsdl       1.2
  libsdl-mixer 1.2
  libsdl-image 1.2
  libcurl      7.15.1
  zlib         1.2.3

If MySQL is installed, the game module will be capable of loging frags to a
database for web based statistics generation.

Quake2World builds with GNU Autotools.  To build it, run the following:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make && sudo make install

GAME DATA INSTALLATION (DEFAULT CONFIG OPTIONS*)

Game data for a default installation may be obtained and synced
using the following commands:

  cd /usr/local/share
  sudo rsync -avz --delete rsync://jdolan.dyndns.org/quake2world quake2world

*Users that have modified their installations should see the game data notes
section to determine the location where Quake2World will look for game data.

Additional downloaded game data and user addons are stored under the
users home directory, i.e. ~/.quake2world.

GAME DATA NOTES

By default, Quake2World looks for the official game data in 

/usr/local/share/quake2world/default

This is known as the basedir. Its location may be modified in the following 
manners
  The basedir may be overridden via the cvar "basedir" 
  The configure option --datadir= may be used to override
    the location of the basedir as follows
      basedir = ${datadir}/quake2world/default
    datadir defaults to ${prefix}/share
  The configure option --prefix= affects the location of basedir in the
    absence of a --datadir= option as follows
      basedir = ${prefix}/share/quake2world/default
