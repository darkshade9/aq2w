speed	default 150

Plats are always drawn in the extended position, so they will light correctly.

If the plat is the target of another trigger or button, it will start out disabled in the extended position until it is trigger, when it will lower and become a normal plat.

"speed"	overrides default 200.
"accel" overrides default 500
"lip"	overrides default 8 pixel lip

If the "height" key is set, that will determine the amount the plat moves, instead of being implicitly determoveinfoned by the model's height.

Set "sounds" to one of the following:
1) base fast
2) chain slow
